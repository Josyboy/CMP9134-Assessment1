# PRIVACY POLICY

## Overview

This system follows the principles of **Privacy by Design** in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In order to fulfil the Mission Logging (Audit Trail) requirements of the Ground Control Station, the system processes limited Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We are committed to applying **Data Minimisation** and **Storage Limitation** principles to ensure that only necessary data is collected and retained only for as long as required.

## What Personal Data We Collect

The system collects the following PII:

* **Usernames / User IDs** of authenticated users issuing commands
* **Timestamps** of actions performed
* **Command details** associated with a specific user
* **IP addresses** (where applicable for system security and traceability)

No additional personal data (e.g., full names, email addresses, or personal contact details) is collected unless strictly required for authentication purposes.

## Why We Collect This Data

This data is collected solely to:

* Maintain a secure **Mission Audit Trail**
* Ensure accountability for commands sent to the robot
* Support incident investigation and safety compliance
* Meet the assessment requirement for mission logging within the Ground Control Station

The collection of this data is necessary to ensure operational safety, traceability, and compliance with system requirements.

## How We Secure and Store Data

All audit logs are stored securely and protected through:

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Only users assigned the *Auditor* or authorised administrative roles may access audit logs.
* **Authentication and authorisation controls** to prevent unauthorised access.
* **Encrypted storage and secure communication protocols** where applicable.
* **Storage limitation policies** – Audit logs are retained only for the minimum period necessary to satisfy safety, legal, or academic requirements, after which they are securely deleted.

We do not sell, share, or use collected personal data for any purpose other than system security, auditing, and compliance.
